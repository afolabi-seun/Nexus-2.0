## Architecture Conventions

- **Clean Architecture** — 4 layers: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Api. Dependencies flow inward only.
- **Entity-named subfolders** — Repositories and Services are organized into subfolders named after the entity they manage (e.g., `Repositories/Organizations/OrganizationRepository.cs`). Namespaces match folder paths.
- **ApiResponse envelope** — All API responses wrapped in `ApiResponse<T>` with `ResponseCode`, `Success`, `Data`, `ErrorCode`, and `CorrelationId`.
- **DomainException pattern** — Business rule violations throw typed exceptions (e.g., `OrganizationNotFoundException`) with error codes, HTTP status codes, and correlation IDs. Caught by `GlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware`.
- **Middleware pipeline** — CORS → CorrelationId → GlobalExceptionHandler → Serilog → RateLimiter → Routing → Auth → JwtClaims → TokenBlacklist → RoleAuthorization → OrganizationScope → Controllers.
- **Polly resilience** — Inter-service HTTP calls use retry (3x exponential), circuit breaker (5 failures / 30s), and timeout (10s).
- **Redis outbox** — Audit events published via `LPUSH outbox:{service}` for async processing by UtilityService.

## How to Run

```bash
# Automated (from project root)
make setup    # Creates DBs, starts all services, seeds test data
make start    # Start services only
make status   # Check health

# Manual
cd src/backend/ProfileService/ProfileService.Api
dotnet run
```

Service starts at `http://localhost:5002`. Swagger UI at `/swagger`.
Health checks at `/health` and `/ready` (checks PostgreSQL + Redis).

## Seed Data

The seed scripts (`make seed`) create 2 organizations with OrgAdmins, departments, and team members.
See [docs/setup-guide.md](../../docs/setup-guide.md) for full seed data details.

## Environment Variables

See [`.env.example`](ProfileService.Api/.env.example) for all variables. Key settings:

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `DATABASE_CONNECTION_STRING` | PostgreSQL connection string |
| `REDIS_CONNECTION_STRING` | Redis host:port |
| `JWT_SECRET_KEY` | Shared JWT signing key |
| `SECURITY_SERVICE_BASE_URL` | SecurityService URL for credential generation |
| `UTILITY_SERVICE_BASE_URL` | UtilityService URL for audit logging |
| `INVITE_EXPIRY_HOURS` | Invite token TTL (default: 48) |
| `MAX_DEVICES_PER_USER` | Max registered devices (default: 5) |
| `SERVICE_SECRET` | Shared secret for service-to-service auth |
