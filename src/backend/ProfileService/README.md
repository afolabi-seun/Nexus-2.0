## Architecture Conventions

- **Clean Architecture** — 4 layers: Domain → Application → Infrastructure → Api. Dependencies flow inward only.
- **Entity-named subfolders** — Repositories and Services are organized into subfolders named after the entity they manage (e.g., `Repositories/Organizations/OrganizationRepository.cs`). Namespaces match folder paths.
- **ApiResponse envelope** — All API responses wrapped in `ApiResponse<T>` with `ResponseCode`, `Success`, `Data`, `ErrorCode`, and `CorrelationId`.
- **DomainException pattern** — Business rule violations throw typed exceptions (e.g., `OrganizationNotFoundException`) with error codes, HTTP status codes, and correlation IDs. Caught by `GlobalExceptionHandlerMiddleware`.
- **Middleware pipeline** — CORS → CorrelationId → GlobalExceptionHandler → Serilog → RateLimiter → Routing → Auth → JwtClaims → TokenBlacklist → RoleAuthorization → OrganizationScope → Controllers.
- **Polly resilience** — Inter-service HTTP calls use retry (3x exponential), circuit breaker (5 failures / 30s), and timeout (10s).
- **Redis outbox** — Audit events published via `LPUSH outbox:{service}` for async processing by UtilityService.
